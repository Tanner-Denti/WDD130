    <h2>Tanner Denti</h2>
    <p>I've been married for 2 years and I'm looking for an internship right now. I try to get outside as often as I can, and lately I've been playing a lot of pickle ball. </p><p>I'm a computer science student with a minor in accounting and certificates in machine learning and data science. BYU-Idaho has been pretty flexible in terms of degree planning, which is probably one of the things I like most about it. One of the career paths I'm loosely interested in is cloud computing, which seems to require knowledge of web languages, so I want to learn html, css, and javascript to be a more well rounded programmer.</p><p></p>I've been in the church my whole life and my favorite scripture is matthew 6:24. </p>
