                <h2>C# Raylib Cycle Game</h2>
                <p>In this project I used object oriented programming to remake a classic computer game called cycle. 
                    Based off of the movie "Tron", the objective of the game is to make the opponent run into the "light stream" 
                    left behind your motorcycle, then you win.</p>

                <h2>C# Unity Fighting Game</h2>
                <p>In this project I used the Unity real-time framework to create a three dimensional fighting game. The
                    goal with this project was to emulate the super smash brothers style of game. While it isn't quite there yet, it 
                    is well on its way to looking and feeling very similar. </p>

                <h2>Python data project</h2>
                <p>In this project I used the pandas, numpy, and altair libraries to create a report. The purpose of this
                    report was to show trends in different names through time.
