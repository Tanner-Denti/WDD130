      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>The purpose of this website will be to display the personal projects that I have worked on as a computer 
        science student here at BYU-Idaho. I will display some of my school work, some of my personal work, and some of the
        projects that I've worked on with teams. Hopefully, this will be a good way to consolidate the work I'm most
        proud of to more easily demonstrate to employers that I am a competent software/data engineer.</p>  <!-- change this -->
      

      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>This site is intended for future employers, and others who may wish to work with me in the future.</p>  <!-- change this -->

      <h2>
        Content
      </h2>
      <h3>Page 1: Home page</h3>
      
      <h4>Purpose</h4>
      <p>This site is eventually intended to display and demonstrate all of the skills that I have learned so far 
        as a computer science student and aspiring software/data engineer. For now, the point of this website will 
        be to show what I have learned about web development so far. I intend to slowly but surely add additional resources 
        to show my relevant skills in software and data engineering. 
      </p>
      <h4>Demonstrate Skill</h4>
      <p>Prospective employers will want to know if I am actually proficient in the skills that I say I have on my resume. 
        This portfolio website gives me the opportunity to put my money where my mouth is and prove to employers that they are 
        making a good investment in me.
      </p>
      <h4>Display Projects</h4>
      <p>On my home page, I will eventually have different content to display my projects including video demonstrations of what I have done, 
        links to github projects that I specifically want to show off, screenshots if they are relevant, and links to markdown files 
        that contain data analysis projects. Visitors should expect to view this media in order to get an understanding of what I can do for them. 
        I won't require information from anyone, however, if an employer wants to reach me, I may have a "contact" option that will allow them to 
        get a hold of me via email. 
      </p>
      <h4>Future Plans</h4>
      <p>Once the homepage if fully crafted, I don't intend for it to have very much text on it at all. There will be hyperlinks to other parts 
        of the website that may include text. There will be titles, and short descriptions for each project that I include. I will try to keep 
        these descriptions brief while at the same time including all of the relevant technologies that I used for the projects. I will 
        also include an updated resume so that employers can quickly and easily see a summary of my background if they want. 
      </p>
      <h4>Future Plans</h4>
      <p>Eventually, I will add more pages to the website. If I can figure out a way to give each project its own page, and create a full 
        write up of what I did, that would be really cool to me. Eventually, I would like to have this portfolio completed in react.js, and 
        use other tools if possible in the creation of this portfolio. Then, the portfolio itself will be something to really show off because 
        of the technologies used to build it.

      </ul>
      <h3>"Page 2: About Me"</h3>
      <h4>Purpose</h4>
      <p>
        I will have a section called "about me". Here, I will speak to who I am as a person. First I will give an introduction to who I am, 
        where I am from, and the university I attend. I want to give more details about my current education and plans for my future education. 
        I'll talk about why I switched from accounting to computer science, 
        why I chose to do certificates in data science and machine learning, what masters program I plan to attend, and what my interests 
        are. I will also include a professional picture of me, and I may include one of my family as well. 
      </p>
      <h4>Added Detail</h4>
      <p>
        I want to talk a little about what I do for fun and show some pictures of the things I enjoy doing most. I may create a collage for this, 
        but I may also just include a few pictures. 
      </p>

      </ul>
      <h3>Page 3: Contact Me</h3>
      <h4>Purpose</h4>
      <p>
        This page will be for a prospective employer to contact me. I plan to create a form that they can 
        fill out which will send me a message via email. The person can enter their name, the company they are with (if any), 
        and give a reason for the inquiry. I may add more catagories to the form, but those are the ones I will use for now.
